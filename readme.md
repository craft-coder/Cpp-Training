# üöÄ C++ Training Repository

This repository is used as a starting point for the C++ training.

## üî® Required tools

To start C++ development the following tools are useful/required:

* A recent C++ Compiler (e.g. GCC 12, Clang 14)
* Git
* CMake
* A code editor (e.g. VS Code)

## üèÅ Getting started

To get started please try to follow the steps:

* Clone the repository including its submodules

  ```sh
  git clone --recurse-submodules [repository_url]
  ```

* Open the cloned repository in your favorite editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code)

  ```sh
  cd [repository_directory]
  code .
  ```

* Execute the CMake *Configure* step (within your editor or the command line)

  ```sh
  ‚ùØ cmake -B build -S .
